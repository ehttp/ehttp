	 * other routers where it makes sense.\n
	 * That'll let higher-level code more easily implement other routing styles
	 * without having to squeeze it into a global dictionary of paths (think
	 * MVC routing), and let you mount other routing styles onto each other
	 * where it makes sense.
	 * 
	 * @todo Placeholders in routes, probably Flask-style <key>/<path:key>
	 * expressions. C++11 offers regular expressions, use that.
