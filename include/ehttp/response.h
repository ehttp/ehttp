	/**
	 * Represents an HTTP Response.
	 * 
	 * Unlike \ref request, response is more of a generator than a simple
	 * container. The reason for this is obviously that our main order of
	 * business here is generating responses, rather than requests.
	 * 
	 * The API is designed to make it easy to chain calls. For example, a
	 * simple response can be generated with:
	 * 
	 *     res->begin()
	 *         ->header("Content-Type", "text/plain")
	 *         ->write("Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet")
	 *         ->end()
	 * 
	 * To make a chunked response, either use begin_chunk(), chunk::write() and
	 * chunk::end_chunk(), or call make_chunked(), which will cause all
	 * sequential write() calls to write chunks.
	 * 
	 * You don't have to care whether a response is chunked or not at any given
	 * time:\n
	 * Non-chunked calls will automatically write chunks if the response is
	 * chunked, otherwise add to a buffer.\n
	 * Chunked calls will make the response chunked if it's not, immediately
	 * writing a chunk consisting of any data written using non-chunked calls.
