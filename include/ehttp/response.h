	 * business here is generating responses, rather than requests.
	 * 
	 * @todo Clean up the messy chunk implementation.\n
	 * The response can enter a chunked state and write the header on the first
	 * call to chunk::end(), removing the need for end_chunked(), and end()
	 * could actually do what it sounds like.\n
	 * This all seemed like a good idea at the time! I was thinking too much
	 * about the HTTP spec and not enough about the interface usability. Always
	 * think about the usability.
